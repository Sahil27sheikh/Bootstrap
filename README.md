<h2>Bootstrap</h2>
<b>In this repository, I have added a little part of whatever I know about Bootstrap.
Because Bootstrap is such a big program that it is not possible to do it in one go. But
still, in this I have created Bootstrap Columns, Rows, Grid System, Bootstrap with flex box,
Nasted method in bootstrap and a single mini project in which I have created a custom navbar with
the help of HTML, Bootstrap and CSS which is fully responsive and runs smoothly on all screen
types.</b>
